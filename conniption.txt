conniption
A WebSocket-based framework for creating fast and fun browser games
Designed to be as fast, stable, secure, and extensible as possible.

Features:
	-Packet structures
	-Game Room management
	-Server configuration/logging

Use prototypes to add new functions or properties to PlayerCommon, Packet, Room, etc.
OR you can even extend them, yeah?

So how does this all actually work?
When a player connects, they are held in the home Playerarray
When they join a Room, they get moved in there.

-When a client first joins, it will fetch a list of games from the server.
	sends packet: fetch. expects a fetch back.
-When a client decides to make their own game, it will send a list of parameters to the server who will then make that room
	Sends packet: makeroom. excepts a makeroom back.
-When a client decides to join a room, they send a join packet. If they are allowed to join the room with the ID they specified, they get a join packet back.

Make Rooms and Players emit EVENTS! That then can be modified by a user of Conniption...

Using a client:
connect("fetch") will request a packet, that contains a list of all game rooms.
connect("make") will make a new game and join it.
connect("join") will join the room with the same ID as our roomID variable.


To do:
-make the client game object accept and acknowledge the playercommon list. - handle "players" packet
	-youll probably have to work harder on the Game object... in a client, that is.
-make lost/found clients act appropriately - sending a connect/disconnect packet
-preface all conniption internal packets with _ or something.
-functions for changing progress state of a room?
	-Game Pause, Game Stop, etc.
-Blacklist and whitelist stuff
-DOCUMENT EVERYTHING!!

-maybe: make players and rooms extend the event class thing? so they can trigger events of their own.

-fill in all them empty functions...
-assess what functionality is missing in this, from the earlier project.
	-look at the old config file
-commands n shit
	-global commands, and commands only usable by a host.
-new kind of Packet: a JSONPacket that holds a JSON object by default, instead of just a message.
-how to make a player? and how to make the player easily extensible? ooh.
	-how to extend it at all? It has something to do with modifying prototypes, yes?
-how to make an easy client-side framework that can be used in pure JS?

thoughts for the future:
	-how can a player timing out send more updates about how long they have left to reconnect?
		-this would probably need a new timer in player.lost()
